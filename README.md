## Get A Shell üêö

Have you ever wanted to just spin up a quick server that you can ssh into to test something real quick? Well with get a shell you can just spin up the UI select a distro and click _Get me a shell!_ and boom you have an ssh server with your specified distro. No need to spin up vms, run commands or anything harder than a click!

> Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è: The app is in early stages of development, I am still quite new to both writing full stack apps and using technologies like drizzle and react. Any contributions are welcome.

### Installation ‚è¨

The installation is very simple and straight forward. You will firstly need to generate a super secure secret key with openssl. This can be done with this command:

```Bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Now you simply need to take the output (which will be something like this: `0sWoIgLqYIskcvHbe4mENjj9btHKuOS3vDdYzhob6Mg=`) and put it in the [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml) file in the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable:

Finally just start the app with this command:

```Bash
docker compose up -d
```

Alternatively you can run the application with a simple docker run command, you will still need to run the openssl command and get the secret key though. Here is the full docker run command:

```Bash
docker run -t -d --name getashell --restart unless-stopped -p 3000:3000 -v ./data:/app/data -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -e SECRET_KEY=verylongsupersecretkeythatnobodywillsee --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway ghcr.io/steveiliop56/getashell:latest
```

> Note üóíÔ∏è: If you don't want to run all of these commands you can install the app through [Runtipi](https://runtipi.io) which will configure everything for you.

### Contributing ‚ù§Ô∏è

As I mentioned above I am fairly new to all these technologies and my code may be _probably is_ terrifying to look at. Any contributions on fixing my mistakes (lol) are welcome. In order to get started follow the Contribution Guide [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).
